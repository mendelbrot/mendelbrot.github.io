This is a board game I made up.  It uses the tiles, cards, and pieces from the popular game Settlers of Catan.  As well, it uses some pieces from Terraforming Mars, the Meeples of Carcassonne, and a jar of dimes (all of which can be substituted for other available alternatives). 

It's a 3-4 player game that's meant to be not too complicated to learn and play, with games lasting roughly 3 hours.  

## Overview

Early game civilizations sporadically acquire the resources wheat, sheep, metal, wood, and clay a la Catan.  These resources are used to build roads, cities, knights, and factories, and to acquire monuments.  

Workers occupy land and demark territory.  They get resources from the land.  Once factories are built, workers in factories generate money.  Workers need cities to support them.

Factories (and to some extent monuments) provide a steady influx of money which can be exchanged for resources.  As the game progresses, a civilization relies more on money and less on resources from dice rolls.

Monuments are a minimal representation of large-scale civil or cultural improvements, or technological advancement.  They provide the benefits of income from cities, naval prowess that allows knights to be carried over sea, and overall military advantage.  There are five monument cards.  Collecting all of them is one way to win the game.  

Knights are the basic military units of the game, however they can only attack opponents when they are lead by a Knight Commander.  Commanders need more resources to train than ordinary knights, and there are a limited number of them.

The key variables in battle are numbers and advantage.  When there are higher numbers of knights supporting eachother they all have a greater chance of surviving.  Pivotal advantage can be gained from terrain, city walls, and monuments.  Attack advantage can also be gained by spending on supplies and weapons.

Conquering all capital cities is the other way to win the game.  However once you take an opponents' capital, they surrender to you.  They must give you all their money and resources, but then you can't attack them any more unless they attack you first.
