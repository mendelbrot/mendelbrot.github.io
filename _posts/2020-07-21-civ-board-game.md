This is a board game I made up.  It uses the tiles, cards, and pieces from the popular game Settlers of Catan.  As well, it uses some pieces From Terraforming Mars, the Meeples of Carcassonne, and a jar of dimes (all of which can be substituted for other available alternatives). 

It's a 3-4 player game that's meant to be not too complicated to learn and play, with games lasting roughly 3 hours.  

Early game civilizations sporadically acquire the resources wheat, sheep, metal, wood, and clay a la Catan.  These resources are used to build roads, cities, knights, and factories, and to acquire monuments.  

Factories (and to some extent monuments) provide a steady influx of money which can be exchanged for resources.  As the game progresses, a civilization relies more on money and less on resources from dice rolls.
