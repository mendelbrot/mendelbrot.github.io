This is a civilization board game I made up.  It uses the tiles, cards, and pieces from the popular game Settlers of Catan.  As well, it uses some pieces from Terraforming Mars, the Meeples of Carcassonne, and a jar of dimes (all of which can be substituted for other available alternatives). 

It's a 3-4 player game that's meant to be minimal and uncomplicated relative to other civ games.  Games last roughly 3 hours.  

## Overview

Empires sporadically acquire the resources wheat, sheep, metal, wood, and clay a la Catan.  These resources are used to build roads, cities, knights, and factories, and to create monuments.  

Workers occupy land and demark territory.  They get resources from the land.  Once factories are built, workers in factories generate money.  Workers need cities to support them.

Factories (and to some extent monuments) provide a steady influx of money which can be exchanged for resources.  As the game progresses, a civilization relies more on money and less on resources from dice rolls.  A civilization can begin to build factories after they create their first monument.  

Monuments are a minimal representation of large-scale civil or cultural improvements, or technological advancement.  They provide the benefits of income from cities, naval prowess allowing knights to be carried over sea, the technological knowledge needed to build factories, and overall military advantage.  There are five monument cards.  Collecting all of them is one way to win the game.  

Knights are the basic military units of the game, however they can only attack opponents when they are lead by a Knight Commander.  Commanders need more resources to train than ordinary knights, and an empire can have only a limited number of them at one time.

The key variables in battle are numbers and advantage.  When there are higher numbers of knights supporting each other they all have a greater chance of surviving.  Advantage can also be gained from terrain, city defenses, and monuments (military and industrial knowledge).  Attack advantage can be gained by spending on supplies and weapons.

Conquering all capital cities is the second way to win.  However once you take an opponents' capital, they surrender to you.  They must give you all their money and resources, but then you can't attack them any more unless they attack you first. 

Early game strategy is about grabbing territory and building cities.  In the mid-early game the empires generally save in order to build the first monument, and may also try to conquer an opponent city if the opportunity presents.  In the mid game, empires strike a balance between spending their resources on monuments, factories, and knights.  The late game has monument stealing, naval battles, and the movement and counter movement of knights culminating in conquest.
