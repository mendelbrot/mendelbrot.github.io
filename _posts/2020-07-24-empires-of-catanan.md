This is a civilization board game.  It uses the tiles, cards, and pieces from the popular game Settlers of Catan.  As well, it uses some pieces from Terraforming Mars, the Meeples of Carcassonne, and a jar of dimes (all of which can be substituted for other available alternatives).



## Overview

Empires sporadically acquire the resources wheat, sheep, metal, wood, and clay.  These resources are used to build roads, cities, knights, and factories, and to create monuments.  

Workers occupy land and demark territory.  They get resources from the land.  Once factories are built, workers in factories generate money.  Workers need cities to support them.

Factories (and to some extent monuments) provide a steady influx of money which can be exchanged for resources.  As the game progresses, a civilization relies more on money and less on resources from dice rolls.  A civilization can begin to build factories after they create their first monument.  

Monuments are a minimal representation of large-scale civil or cultural improvements, or technological advancement.  They provide the benefits of income from cities, naval prowess allowing knights to be carried over sea, the technological knowledge needed to build factories, and overall military advantage.  There are five monument cards.  Collecting all of them is one way to win the game.  

Knights are the basic military units of the game, however they can only attack opponents when they are lead by a Knight Commander.  Commanders need more resources to train than ordinary knights, and an empire can have only a limited number of them at one time.

In battle, having greater numbers relative to your opponent means increased advantage for each of your knights.  Advantage can also be gained from terrain, city defenses, and monuments (military and industrial knowledge).  Attack advantage can be bought by spending on supplies and weapons.

Conquering all capital cities is the second way to win.  However once you take an opponents' capital, they surrender to you and you can not attack them again unless they attack you first. 

Early game strategy is about grabbing territory, building cities and deciding how best to spend your resources.  In the mid-early game the empires generally save in order to build the first monument, and may also try to conquer an opponent city if the opportunity presents.  

Building is usually a better strategy than attacking.  There's a compounding exponential buildup when income is re-invested in factories, monuments, and cities.  The first empire to make it to the take off point (which happens at around $30/turn) is very likely to win.  

## The Board and Pieces

This is the board that I use:

The tiles are randomly placed.  The numbers are randomly put on every tile except for the deserts.  Cities, factories, and knights are placed on the tiles.  Workers are placed on the tiles and on factories.  Roads are placed across the boundaries that connect one tile to another.  The ocean tiles are irregular shapes (as shown).  The Catan resource trading markers (sailboats) show the points at which crossing betweens continents is possible.

### *Definition*

*A tile belongs to an empires' territory when it has one of that empires' workers on it.*
