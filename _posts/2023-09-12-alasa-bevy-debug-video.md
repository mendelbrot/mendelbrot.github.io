The other night I was trying out a new framework, [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), 
and had some difficulty getting the code to compile. 
The next day I decide I would re-use the effort I spent trying the fix the problem: 
I made a 15 minute video about it. 
Talking through this helped me to identify behavior patterns and to become more efficient at overcoming these kinds of tooling related problems.
