I migrated my blog site from Jekyll to Eleventy.  The reason I switched is my blog was getting neglected and one of the barriers to working on it was yet again installing Ruby on my new OS and starting it up.  I also though it was time for me to try something new.  

Initially it was a greater barrier to set up 11ty than it was for Jekyll.  With Jekyll I used the minima template which works out of the box and I barely had to do any work.  In contrast, with 11ty, i didn't use a template.  Instead I studied other people's code, learned how it worked, and made it from scratch.  There were other complications, like three version of 11ty used by different example sites, and not much standardization around the directory structure of the sites because 11ty is not an opinionated framework.  

But now the setup is all but done, it's mine, and I'm happy with how it's turning out.

Here is [the repo](https://github.com/mendelbrot/mendelbrot.github.io).  the rest of this post ia a copy of the readme as it stands today.
