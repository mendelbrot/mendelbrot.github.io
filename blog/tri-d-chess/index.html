<p>This post is about the 3D chess game that was a prop on the original Star Trek series. Some trekkies have built their own Tri-D chess sets and made up rules based on blueprints and instructions written it the 1975 Star Fleet Technical Manual [14].  I'll summarize the most popular way of playing Tri-D chess, giving a brief history with some references, and will give a summary of the currently popular fan-made rules.</p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/exploring-tri-d-chess-rules">this subsequent post</a> I discuss some principles for inventing rules for this sort of chess, which I call <em>multi-level chess</em>, and I share a set of rules-in-progress that I made up myself.</p>

<h2>Where from? Where to?</h2>
<p>According to [2], Andrew Bartmess might have been one of the first people to invent a detailed set of rules (although I haven't seen them firsthand because they are not free). He's still selling his rules from his website [5]. I found the 1975 Star Fleet Technical Manual [14] that inspired Bartmess as a child. The brief description of Tri-D chess in this manual has set the direction of development of the popular form of the game.</p>
<p>The 1975 manual has the first instance that I know of where the name <em>tridimensional</em> is used. This has taken hold, and &quot;Tri-Dimensional chess&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;Tri-D chess&quot;) universally means Star Trek 3D chess. The starting arrangement, a sketch of the movement rules, and the attack board rules were also all set down here in just two brief paragraphs.</p>
<p>From [6] and [7], the chess master and physicist Leroy Dubeck [8] was hired to make rules for a booklet to go with a Franklyn mint Tri Dimensional collector's chess board. The documentary [6] is quite entertaining, especially regarding what Dubeck had to say. These quotes are transcribed from that video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never had a passion then or now for 3D chess. I got my cheque. I put away the Star Trek board and set, where it sat in a closet, for decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular Chess has far more applications in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not think you need to be a genius to play 3D chess. It doesn't make you any smarter. And if you're really smart, you're too smart to play 3D chess, 'cus you see it's a waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's ironic coming from me, someone who is interested in this kind of chess (clearly), but I largely agree with Dubeck. Classical chess has a lot of benefits over tri-d or 3d chess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical chess is simpler to learn.</li>
<li>You can take in the position at a glance.</li>
<li>You can play easily on a flat screen or surface.</li>
<li>You don't need to have a complicated contraption as a chess board.</li>
<li>I've tried both tri-d chess and classical chess. I find that, contrary to appearance, tri-d chess is not more complex, and classical chess games are more stimulating and fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to work on this kind of chess anyway though because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Star Trek Tri-D chess set is beautiful.  It is itself a work of art.</li>
<li>Building a multi-level chess set is fun.</li>
<li>Inventing rules for the game is also fun, and I have hope that with better rules the game can be as awesome to play as the chess set looks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't able to find the Dubeck rules, although I would go out on a limb and say that he probably just fleshed out the rules from the 1975 manual.</p>
<p>From what I've generally seen, the Meder rules laid out in [4] are how people play (and the Meder rules are also compatible with the 1975 manual with some added rules and clarifications).  As far as I can tell, the Meder rules are basically the same as the Tri-dimensional chess league rules [9]. If you want to try out these rules, I would recommend the Tri D Chess app on android [13].</p>
<p>Does Tri-D chess have a future?  It seems unlikely to take off into the mainstream or compete with classical chess, but I think there will always be some people like me who will be interested in this esoteric game based on a prop in a 1960's TV show.</p>
<p>I have a way of defining/categorizing the types of 3D chess games:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3D chess:</strong> In a general sense, 3D chess is any chess with boards on multiple levels. In a more specific sense, I consider 3D chess to be chess that is played in a 3D space, where piece movement is an extrapolation of 2D movement into 3D. Examples of this are <em>Raumschach</em> [3], and [18].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>multi-level chess:</strong> This is a term I made up. It is chess played on multiple levels like 3D chess, except that piece movement is not an extrapolation of 2D movement into 3D (so it's not strictly about 3D space). Instead, there are a variety of possible rules for movement between levels. One example of multi-level chess is the popular form of Tri-D chess discussed here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tri-Dimensional chess:</strong> This is the specific chess game (and variations of it) that Star Trek fans have invented, as in the Meder site [4], and the Tri D Chess League [9].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Board arrangement</h2>
<p>These diagrams show the starting positions and board arrangement. They are fom Meder [4] and awsoft [11]:</p>
<p>| <img src="/assets/images/star-trek-chess/meder-initial-reduced.png" alt="initial arrangement meder"> | <img src="/assets/images/star-trek-chess/awsoft-starting.png" alt="initial arrangement awsoft"> |
| <img src="/assets/images/star-trek-chess/meder-notation-diagram.gif" alt="meder board notation diagram"> | <img src="/assets/images/star-trek-chess/meder-side-diagram.gif" alt="meder board side diagram"> |</p>
<h2>A sketch of the standard rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The essentially 2d nature:</strong> From above, movement is like in normal chess and you choose which level you end the move on. The Meder rules in [4] state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any move which can be made in a standard chess game (i.e. flat board), can be made in three-dimensional chess. Since every overlapping square is the same colour, you have the option of deciding which level you wish a piece to land on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In [10] Charles Roth says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to play the game is to put it on the floor and look down. This makes it much easier to see &quot;through&quot; the boards and see which squares are directly above and below which.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore Tri-D chess is really a 2D game. REALLY! I might be generous and call it 2-1/2 D. To me this indicates that there's something lacking as the rules themselves don't justify using a multi-level board. The game can more easily be played on a modified flat board where multiple pieces can share a square.</p>
<p>From another perspective though, the similarity with 2d chess is a positive feature because it allows people to learn the game more easily. I think of the 2D movement ending on multiple levels as a basic starting point for exploring other multi-level chess variants (the topic of another post).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking:</strong> Path moving pieces like the Queen, Bishop, and Rook can't go past a square with another piece on a level above or below it. Again quoting the Meder rules [4]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A piece, on any individual square, blocks the ability of other pieces to move at all levels ... But the moving piece may land above or below the occupied square and continue its move on the next turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a good rule, I use it in my own multi-level chess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The moving/inverting attack boards:</strong> The four little 2x2 boards (attached by pillars to the corners of the main boards) are called <em>attack boards</em>. The attack boards are allowed to move if certain conditions are met. Usually the rule is you can move an attack board to a neighboring corner if it has just one piece on it or if it has no pieces on it. Also, attack boards can invert as a move. So an attack board's pillar can extend upward form the main board its attached to so that it is above that board, or it can hang downward so it's below the main board its attached to. Flipping the attack board counts as a move.</p>
<p>These rules, as well as the name attack board are originally from the 1975 manual and adopted by all the standard rules that I've seen. And none of this I like.</p>
<p>I prefer to call the attack boards <em>corner levels</em> or <em>half-levels</em>.  The way I play, they don't invert, and they also don't move during the game (for a number of reasons aesthetic and practical). I randomly select the positions of the half-levels before the start of the game, and to make it more fair, the second player to move gets to choose their side of the board.</p>
<p>I think moving/inverting attack boards add a lot of unnecessary rules and physical complexity that don't contribute to making the game better. This is highlighted by <em>Occam's Razor of game design</em>. I'm making up the wording here but the idea is not original to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a feature or rule doesn't improve the game by adding an interesting strategy or side game, then remove that feature. The rules should be a minimal set that achieves the desired effect.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>The Tri-D chess set is a beautiful design and It's fun to design game rules for it. I think I can improve on the current popular rules, <a href="/blog/exploring-tri-d-chess-rules">this is the topic of another post</a>. Tri-D chess is a <em>multi-level</em> chess variants, a category that I made up.</p>
